            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The final goal of the game is to leave the opponent only with 2 pieces, or to block all the opponent
                    pieces, so that they may not be moved.
                </li>
                <li>The way of approaching to that objective is to build mills (3 pieces in an straight line), which
                    gives the right to capture one opponent piece.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    colour
                </li>
